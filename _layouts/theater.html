    title: "As You Like It (CMU)",
    html: `<p>"Bandits on the Run jumped at the chance to create songs for friend of the band / director Peter Anderson's production of As You Like It at Carnegie Mellon University. Not only is As You Like It widely regarded as the queerest of Shakespeare work, this version of the play (which would also feature songs from Twelfth Night) would lean into those queer elements of the play by casting all roles as gender non-conforming. Actors were cast in roles that were best suited to their spirits, and many of the actors' gender identities were different than what one might usually expect them to be from a traditional binaried casting lens. It excited us that we were tasked with writing songs that broke a mold of being for strictly a male or female voice in these famous classical roles. The opening and queering of that casting process opened up a whole boundless sonic universe to play with.`
